A **C++** chess game built with **SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)**. This project demonstrates fundamental concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, **inheritance**, and **polymorphism**, while also leveraging SFML's powerful graphics capabilities for rendering chess pieces and the chessboard.

---

## Features ðŸŒŸ

- **Chessboard Rendering**: An 8x8 grid with alternating light and dark squares.
- **Piece Textures**: Chess pieces (Pawn, Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen, King) are represented with PNG images loaded as textures.
- **Object-Oriented Design**:
  - A base `Piece` class with subclasses for each specific chess piece.
  - Inheritance and polymorphism for customized piece behavior.
- **SFML Integration**: Uses SFML to handle window management, graphics rendering, and events.

## Technologies & Concepts ðŸ”§

This project utilizes the following tools and concepts:

- **C++**: Core programming language for game logic and rendering.
- **SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)**: For rendering the chessboard and managing graphical assets.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**:
  - **Inheritance**: Common functionality in the `Piece` base class, with specialized behavior in subclasses.
  - **Polymorphism**: Different piece behaviors are handled dynamically via method overriding.
- **Textures & Sprites**: Chess pieces are loaded as PNG textures and rendered using SFML sprites.
